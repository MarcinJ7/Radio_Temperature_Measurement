# Remotely temperature measurement device 

Project: Remotely temperature measurement device 

## Project description

This project concernes creating a wireless temperature measuring system and implementation of cooperating PC software. Project had two stages - first was design and choose electronic components and second one was programming. Measurement system was build with Arduino platform and software was implemented in Java. The wireless connection was obtained by radio transmitter and receiver. This kind of deviece gave an opportuinity to wireless monitoring temperatures in choosen locations.

## Hardware
